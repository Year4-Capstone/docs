\section{Resource Management}
\label{sec:resource management}

Effective resource management ensures that the teamâ€™s digital infrastructure supports collaboration, version control, and accountability across all subsystems. Development resources are organized to align with the sprint-based framework and integrated risk controls described in \autoref{sec:team organization} and \autoref{sec:risk_mitigation}.

A GitHub organization stores all the repositories for the Search \& Support Fleet Robotics project. These repositories manage all source code, hardware design files, and formal documentation. The main repository, \texttt{search-support-robots}, serves as a central repo connected to the following submodules:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{dev-tools}: environment setup scripts and instructions.
    \item \textbf{simulation-environment}: Gazebo worlds and URDF configurations.
    \item \textbf{ros-packages}: ROS 2 nodes, launch, and configuration files.
    \item \textbf{mesh-network}: communications and telemetry.
    \item \textbf{hardware-design}: CAD models, wiring diagrams, and schematics.
    \item \textbf{docs}: LaTeX source for reports.
\end{itemize}

This modular structure supports the development of concurrent subsystems and bug traceability, while maintaining version control. Each repository shares a standardized branching model (\textbf{main}, \textbf{feature}, \textbf{bugfix}). Branch protection rules prevent direct pushes to \textbf{main} and require peer-approved pull requests to be merged. In addition, GitHub Actions prevent pull requests from being merged into the \textbf{main} branch unless all related requirements pass. The current requirements include building ROS2 packages, compiling Arduino firmware, and generating Overleaf PDFs without error. These version control safeguards serve as a risk mitigation consistent with \autoref{sec:risk_mitigation}, reducing data loss or corrupted code.

Integration between Jira and GitHub provides traceability between pull requests and task IDs derived in Section 1.1 Features. Microsoft Teams serves as the main platform for non-code communication, as discussed in Section 2.3.2 Communication Channels. Also, Teams stores shared files, meeting notes, and presentation slides. The GitHub organization and all repositories within it are co-owned by the team members to ensure equal access.

\section{Risk Assessment and Mitigation Plan}
\label{sec:risk_mitigation}

A risk assessment has been conducted on the Search \& Support Fleet Robotics project. A standard 5x5 risk matrix is used for devising the risk level from the likelihood and impact of each risk, see \autoref{fig:risk_matrix}.~\cite{boers2025beyond} All risks of the project have been defined and divided into four risk categories: safety, technical, economic and legal. These are reflected in \autoref{tab:risk_identification}. Respective risk level and mitigation techniques are defined in the final two columns of \autoref{tab:risk_identification}.

Each mitigation strategy is covered by a feature or a process. All team members have reviewed each of the mitigation strategies, specifically the defined processes. Mitigation processes will be followed at all times.~\cite{ccohs:risk_assessment}

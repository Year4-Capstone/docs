\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Mining is ranked among the most hazardous industries in the world, with risks of collapses and gas leaks. These incidents not only threaten worker safety but also often damage critical infrastructure, which can lead to loss of communications. Past incidents, such as the Red Chris Mine collapse, underscore the impact of infrastructure loss on delaying rescue efforts.

The Search \& Support Fleet Robotics project proposes a networked fleet of autonomous and remotely operated robots to provide faster, safer, and more reliable disaster relief support. Having multiple units connected through a mesh network, the system is designed to remain functional even when parts of the existing network are compromised.

Along with their networking capabilities, the robots are capable of searching for \gls{persons}, monitoring environmental hazards, and transporting essential supplies until direct rescue operations can be initiated.
